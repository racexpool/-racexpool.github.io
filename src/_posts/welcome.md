**RaceX Pool** is inspired by high-performance cars because we love it and many of the concepts to build a supercar is also true to our Stake pool.

Our main missing is to contribute to Cardano's blockchain, by staking our rewards and our delegator's ADA, to guarantee the security of the network.

## Nodes

Our infrastructure is powered by AWS Cloud, with 3 nodes running 24/7 and 365 days. we aim to have 99.9% availability time.

Lastly the most important point is related to the secuty of our stack, where we take advantage of builtin Firewall to that protect our nodes and the network.
